Pull-Stock-Market-Data-Cron-Job
===============================

Code that gets updated stock quotes for stocks in the database. Updates a portion of your stocks each time it runs. When it finishes a sequence (updates all stocks in database), it starts all over the next time the cronjob is run. Really simple script, no dependancies, these files get the whole job done. Database schema also included along with directions on how to get stock symbols in the database. Hope you enjoy
